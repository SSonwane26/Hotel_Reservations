Perform EDA using Power Query and Data Visualization using Charts and Graphs using Power BI.

The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behaviour. A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.

Steps for Data Analysis
a)	Defining the problem: There is more monthly booking cancelations. So, task is to reduce monthly cancelations. 
b)	Data collection: Data is collected from hotel servers and from entry sheets.
c)	Data cleaning and pre-processing: Power Query for data cleaning.
d)	Exploratory data analysis: QnA type data analysis.
e)	Applying analytical techniques: Use DAX Functions for total nights, total bookings etc. 
f)	Data Visualization: Used charts and graphs for data visualizations.
g)	Interpretation and reporting: Create clean and beautiful Dashboard.
